Cortex: Storage Layer Details
=============================

The storage layer for a Cortex is a standalone object which can be instantiated on its own. This allows the creation
of empty Cortex's, raw data manipulation or reuse of the Storage object for other purposes.  In addition, the clean API
separation between the Cortex and Storage classes allows for additional storage layer backings to be implemented.
