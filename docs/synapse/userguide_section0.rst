This User Guide is written by and for Synapse users.
Additional technical documentation can be found elsewhere in the doc index_.

The User Guide is a living document and will continue to be updated and expanded. The current sections are:

    userguides/userguide_section4
    userguides/userguide_section5
    userguides/userguide_section6
    userguides/userguide_section7

The following sections are still under development:

- Data Model – Tag Concepts
- Synapse Commands
- The Storm Query Language
- Storm Operators and Syntax - Reference
- Storm Queries - Examples

Many of the concepts above are closely interrelated, and the outline above represents a reasonable effort at introducing concepts in a logical order. However, it is difficult to fully understand the potential of Synapse and hypergraphs without grasping the power of the Storm query language to understand, manipulate, and annotate data. Similarly, it’s hard to understand the effectiveness of Storm without knowledge of the underlying data model. **The outline above is our suggested order, but readers are encouraged to skip around, or revisit earlier sections after digesting later sections to better see how these topics are tied together.**
